          Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use. 
          Its goal is to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
        </p>

        <p>
          To do this, it is important to understand the idea of risk in cybersecurity. Risk can be seen as the chance that 
          security measures will fail to protect IT assets. When this happens, the result can be a data breach, a system 
          compromise, or problems for the organization’s work, money, or privacy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Knowing what risk is, however, is only the first step. The real challenge is <strong>measuring it</strong>. 
          This is where statistics becomes useful. Security teams must work with a huge amount of data, from system logs 
          and network traffic to incident reports. Only statistical methods can change this raw information into useful insights.
        </p>

        <p>
          By using statistics, we can estimate the probability of attacks, evaluate the impact of possible breaches, 
          and decide which risks deserve the highest attention. Unlike traditional methods, statistical analysis gives a more 
          exact way to measure cybersecurity risk. Techniques like probabilistic programming, Bayesian statistics, 
          and Monte Carlo simulations help us calculate risk, understand uncertainty, and improve decisions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Practical Applications of Statistics in Cybersecurity</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">1. Log Analysis and Anomaly Detection</h3>
        <p>
          Every IT system produces a constant stream of logs: login attempts, file access, error messages, and network traffic. 
          Statistics helps us understand what is normal and what is unusual or suspicious. For example, a sudden increase in failed logins 
          or traffic from an unusual location can be marked as anomalies. Without statistics, these events would stay hidden 
          in the noise of millions of daily records.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Intrusion and Threat Detection</h3>
        <p>
          Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) also use statistics. Older systems check for known attack signatures, but modern ones 
          create profiles of “normal” behavior and give alerts when something is different. This makes it possible to detect new threats 
          that do not match any signature. Statistics also helps balance sensitivity and accuracy, lowering false positives that 
          disturb analysts while making sure true attacks are not ignored.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Risk Management and Decision-Making</h3>
        <p>
          Statistics is also important for managing cybersecurity risk. It makes it possible to estimate the probability 
          and the impact of different attack scenarios, so organizations can set better priorities. Tools like Monte Carlo 
          simulations and Bayesian analysis allow teams to move from simple labels like “high, medium, low risk” to more 
          exact, data-based measures. This way, companies can communicate better with management and make smarter choices 
          about where to spend resources.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In conclusion, statistics is not only a tool for researchers or mathematicians, but also a key element in modern cybersecurity. 
          It helps us move from simple opinions to decisions based on evidence. By using statistics, we can better understand risks, 
          detect unusual behavior, and choose the right strategies to protect data and systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          The future of cybersecurity will depend even more on data. Attacks are becoming faster and more complex, and only a statistical 
          approach can make sense of the large amount of information produced every day. This is why building skills in statistics is 
          essential for anyone who wants to work in this field and for organizations that want to stay safe in the digital world.
